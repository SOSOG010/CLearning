Single Number

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Exmple 1:

```
Input: [2,2,1]
output: 1
```

Exmple 2:

```
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
output: 4
```

```c
int singleNumber(int* nums, int numsSize){
	int n = nums[0];
	for(int i = 1; i < numsSize; i++){
		n ^= nums[i];
	}
	return n;
}
```
